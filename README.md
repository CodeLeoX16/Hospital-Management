# Hospital-Management
Software Development
This project is a basic console-based application that simulates the operations of a healthcare management system. The application allows users to perform several key functions:

Add Patients: Collect and store patient details, such as name, gender, age, address, phone number, and email.

Add Doctors: Collect and store doctor details, including name, address, phone number, email, and specialty.

Schedule Appointments: Schedule appointments by associating patients with doctors, and specifying the date and time of the appointment.

View Patients: Display a list of all registered patients along with their details.

View Doctors: Display a list of all registered doctors along with their details.

View Appointments: Display a list of all scheduled appointments along with patient and doctor details, as well as the date and time of the appointment.

The application uses simple data structures like vectors to store and manage patient, doctor, and appointment data. It provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the system and perform various tasks. The system ensures that each patient, doctor, and appointment has a unique ID for easy identification and management.
