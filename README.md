# 🏥 Hospital Management System

A modern, full-stack Hospital Management System with a C++ backend server and interactive HTML frontend interface.

## ✨ Features

- 👨‍⚕️ Patient Management
- 📅 Appointment Scheduling
- 💊 Prescription Tracking

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these simple steps to get the Hospital Management System up and running:

### Prerequisites
- Windows OS (for running the compiled server.exe)
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- VS Code (recommended)

### Step 1: Start the Backend Server

Open your terminal in VS Code and run:

```bash
./server.exe
```

✅ The server will start and listen for connections. Keep this terminal running!

### Step 2: Launch the Frontend

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser:

**Option A - VS Code:**
- Right-click on `index.html`
- Select "Open with Live Server" (if you have the Live Server extension)

**Option B - Direct:**
- Double-click `index.html` in your file explorer
- Or drag and drop `index.html` into your browser

### Step 3: Use the System

🎉 That's it! The system is now fully operational. You can now:
- Register and manage patients
- Schedule appointments
- Track medical records
- And much more!

├── style.css           # Styling
├── script.js           # Frontend logic
��── code.cpp            # Additional C++ code
```

## 🛠️ VS Code Commands

```bash
# Start the backend server
./server.exe

# The server must be running before opening the HTML interface
```

## 💡 Important Notes

⚠️ **Always start the backend server FIRST** before opening the HTML interface!

The frontend communicates with the backend server, so both must be running simultaneously.
